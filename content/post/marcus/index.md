          Have some self respect

...With every act ask yourself if you are respecting yourself with it and if you will regret it inside.
Watch for and erase any impulse to express things you think you don't truly believe.
Do not view anything as beneficial which casuse you to break  a promise lose your self-respect or hate anyone .
when roused to anger remember  that there is noting manly about giving in to emotion it's courtesy and
kindness that defined a human being and a man he who possesses these qualities possesses strength nerves
and courage not the man who is subject to fits of passion and discontent.
 make yourself  neither of a tyrant nor slave of any man and what ever happends avoid complaning

       The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius
